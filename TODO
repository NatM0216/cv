Programmatic:

- switch to using Jinja2 for adding things in, filter for subtracting
- panfilter collapse any empty sections (for example, after filtering
  out all presentations)
- need way to exclude anything from cv-private (for web site)
- BibTeX bibliography
- include links to papers
- make the Google Scholar parsing a separate script because it is likely to break
