Programmatic:

- add --search-dir=../cv-private for default, but don't include for web site
- switch to using Jinja2 for adding things in, filter for subtracting
- panfilter collapse any empty sections (for example, after filtering
  out all presentations)
- BibTeX bibliography
- include links to papers
- make the Google Scholar parsing a separate script because it is likely to break
